Examining the intersection between academic preparation,
the experiential learning experience, and signature work.
Include three components based on the DEAL Model: describe experience,
examine what skills were acquired and learned,
articulate how the experiential learning contributed to the signature work.

DKU's 7 animating principles:

Rooted Globalism: To cultivate informed and engaged citizens who are
knowledgeable about each other’s histories,
traditions of thought and affiliations; and skilled in navigating among local,
national and global identities and commitments.
This principle is reflected in the required levels of proficiency in English and
Mandarin,
the core courses and comparative study of cultural traditions throughout the
curriculum,
and in co-curricular programming that brings students together to learn from
each other outside the classroom.

Collaborative Problem-Solving: To instill the habits of collaboration and the
ability to synthesize disparate insights in solving complex challenges.
This principle is reflected in an interdisciplinary structure that emphasizes
the integration of knowledge, in pedagogies that include team-based assignments,
and in co-curricular programming that emphasize teamwork.

Research and Practice: To enhance the ability to forge links between theory and
practice in the many-sided and rapidly changing world of human need.
This principle is reflected in the divisional foundations,
which impart the basic skills necessary for critical inquiry across many fields
and problems, and in advanced research in the disciplinary studies,
capstone and signature products.
Experiential opportunities that align the formal curriculum with practica,
internships and other hands-on offerings further link theory and practice.

Lucid Communication: To develop the ability to communicate effectively,
both orally and in writing,
and to listen attentively to different viewpoints in coming to mature judgments.
The common core,
divisional foundation and capstone courses provide multiple opportunities for
sustained, guided practice in writing, speaking and listening.
These are supported by stand-alone and co-courses linked to the core,
by required language proficiencies,
by the focus on a summative project that melds research and practical experience
and by the seminar-style size of most classes.

Independence and Creativity: To nurture free inquiry,
deep reflection and a drive to ask interesting questions and find compelling
answers.
These principles are embodied in the liberal arts design of the
curriculum—placing a premium on exploring ideas and seeking new experiences;
encountering different ways of thinking and living in history, text, image,
culture and methodology,
and in the variety of choices among paths of study and electives.

Wise Leadership: To shape thinkers and doers who possess the moral compass to
guide communities and institutions toward a common good and who have the wisdom
and technical competence to deal effectively with complexity.
This principle is present in core courses that examine the relationship between
individuals and different levels of community and to leading an examined life,
in the many interdisciplinary studies that require knowledge of problems that
span national boundaries and cultures, in the required practicum,
and in the capstone seminars where students integrate specialized knowledge with
broader knowledge and questions.

A Purposeful Life: To form reflective scholars who test their core beliefs,
connect their course of study to big questions of meaning,
and who build the capacity for lifelong learning and exploration.
This principle is reflected in the distinctive capacity of a liberal arts
college to form intentional communities of meaning.
It is brought to life in core courses,
in self-designed capstone work and in an e-portfolio system that captures the
larger inquiry informing a student’s pathway.

# Signature Work Narrative And Experiential Learning Reflection

## Thematic Courses

### COMPSCI 371 - Elements of Machine Learning

Embarking on the journey through COMPSCI 371, the Elements of Machine Learning,
marked a pivotal moment in my academic exploration.
This course not only delved into the intricacies of supervised machine learning
but also meticulously unravelled the core concepts underlying this
transformative field. As I immersed myself in the curriculum,
the acquisition of knowledge extended beyond the mere comprehension of
algorithms;
it encompassed a profound understanding of the critical thinking required to
tackle complex machine learning problems.

A highlight of COMPSCI 371 was the in-depth exploration of neural networks.
This segment not only demystified the complexities of neural architecture but
also laid the groundwork for my journey into iterative model parameter
modification.
Understanding the nuance of optimizing specific loss functions became an
intellectual cornerstone, enriching my grasp of the underlying principles.
Moreover, exposure to diverse approaches,
including decision forests and support vector machines,
provided a panoramic view of machine learning methodologies,
fostering a holistic perspective on this dynamic field.

### COMPSCI 311 - Computer Network Architecture

In the landscape of computer networks, COMPSCI 311,
or Computer Network Architecture, emerged as a keystone in my academic odyssey.
This course acted as a beacon,
illuminating the layered architecture of network protocol stacks.
Practical programming exercises and insightful case studies drawn from the vast
expanse of the Internet augmented my comprehension of network concepts.

The profound relevance of COMPSCI 311 to the FedCampus project cannot be
overstated.
The detailed exploration of TCP/IP and HTTP in the course laid the groundwork
for understanding the intricate communication between smartphones and our
backend server.
This comprehension became indispensable in the context of our Representational
State Transfer (REST) API. Additionally,
the course's exploration of wireless and mobile networking directly correlated
with the network connections prevalent in smartphones,
proving instrumental in the conceptualization and execution of the FedCampus
initiative.

### COMPSCI 402 - Artificial Intelligence

In the intellectual realm of Artificial Intelligence,
COMPSCI 402 emerged as a crucible of knowledge,
refining my insights into machine learning. As the course unfolded,
it encompassed a spectrum of topics,
ranging from uninformed and informed search strategies to the intricate world of
neural networks and game theory.
The comprehensive overview provided me with a nuanced understanding of the
decision-making processes inherent in machine learning,
emphasizing the strategic importance of leveraging historical data.

The flexibility afforded by COMPSCI 402 allowed me to delve into the literature
on federated learning,
a pivotal exploration that set the stage for my involvement in the FedCampus
project.
This deep dive into federated learning on smartphones became a valuable
precursor to my subsequent work,
laying the foundation for the development of innovative solutions that would
redefine the landscape of collaborative machine learning applications.

### Capstone Courses

The culmination of my academic journey unfolded in the capstone courses,
where the theoretical knowledge amassed from thematic courses converged into a
comprehensive and impactful project.
This amalgamation of expertise resulted in a demonstration paper accepted by the
esteemed 2024 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops. The capstone
courses provided not just a platform but a crucible to synthesize theoretical
knowledge, practical skills,
and visionary ideas into a tangible manifestation of intellectual prowess.

Collaborating synergistically with the FedCampus team,
we propelled the FedCampus Application into the digital realm in December 2023.
This real-world application of federated learning stood as a testament to the
interdisciplinary collaboration fostered by DKU's guiding principles.
It showcased not only collaborative problem-solving but also exemplified rooted
globalism and the seamless integration of knowledge across diverse academic
