DKU's 7 animating principles:

Rooted Globalism: To cultivate informed and engaged citizens who are
knowledgeable about each other’s histories,
traditions of thought and affiliations; and skilled in navigating among local,
national and global identities and commitments.
This principle is reflected in the required levels of proficiency in English and
Mandarin,
the core courses and comparative study of cultural traditions throughout the
curriculum,
and in co-curricular programming that brings students together to learn from
each other outside the classroom.

Collaborative Problem-Solving: To instill the habits of collaboration and the
ability to synthesize disparate insights in solving complex challenges.
This principle is reflected in an interdisciplinary structure that emphasizes
the integration of knowledge, in pedagogies that include team-based assignments,
and in co-curricular programming that emphasize teamwork.

Research and Practice: To enhance the ability to forge links between theory and
practice in the many-sided and rapidly changing world of human need.
This principle is reflected in the divisional foundations,
which impart the basic skills necessary for critical inquiry across many fields
and problems, and in advanced research in the disciplinary studies,
capstone and signature products.
Experiential opportunities that align the formal curriculum with practica,
internships and other hands-on offerings further link theory and practice.

Lucid Communication: To develop the ability to communicate effectively,
both orally and in writing,
and to listen attentively to different viewpoints in coming to mature judgments.
The common core,
divisional foundation and capstone courses provide multiple opportunities for
sustained, guided practice in writing, speaking and listening.
These are supported by stand-alone and co-courses linked to the core,
by required language proficiencies,
by the focus on a summative project that melds research and practical experience
and by the seminar-style size of most classes.

Independence and Creativity: To nurture free inquiry,
deep reflection and a drive to ask interesting questions and find compelling
answers.
These principles are embodied in the liberal arts design of the
curriculum—placing a premium on exploring ideas and seeking new experiences;
encountering different ways of thinking and living in history, text, image,
culture and methodology,
and in the variety of choices among paths of study and electives.

Wise Leadership: To shape thinkers and doers who possess the moral compass to
guide communities and institutions toward a common good and who have the wisdom
and technical competence to deal effectively with complexity.
This principle is present in core courses that examine the relationship between
individuals and different levels of community and to leading an examined life,
in the many interdisciplinary studies that require knowledge of problems that
span national boundaries and cultures, in the required practicum,
and in the capstone seminars where students integrate specialized knowledge with
broader knowledge and questions.

A Purposeful Life: To form reflective scholars who test their core beliefs,
connect their course of study to big questions of meaning,
and who build the capacity for lifelong learning and exploration.
This principle is reflected in the distinctive capacity of a liberal arts
college to form intentional communities of meaning.
It is brought to life in core courses,
in self-designed capstone work and in an e-portfolio system that captures the
larger inquiry informing a student’s pathway.

# Signature Work Narrative And Experiential Learning Reflection

Embarking on the intellectual odyssey of my signature work project, FedCampus,
has been a transformative journey that seamlessly blends academic rigor with
real-world applications. As I reflect on this profound experience,
I find myself traversing through three thematic courses that laid the
theoretical groundwork,
engaging in experiential learning activities that acted as a crucible for
practical application,
and finally converging all these threads in the capstone courses to synthesize
knowledge and skills.
This reflection will delve into the intricate details of each phase,
exploring the profound impact of the thematic courses,
the immersive experiential learning activities,
and the culmination of it all in the capstone courses.

In the captivating realm of COMPSCI 371,
the course on Elements of Machine Learning,
I embarked on an intellectual journey that transcended the conventional
boundaries of algorithmic understanding. This course served as the keystone,
unlocking the intricate world of supervised machine learning. Here,
the canvas of my knowledge expanded,
absorbing the nuances of sample algorithms and their real-world applications.
This intellectual expedition delved far beyond the surface,
encouraging a profound comprehension of the critical thinking processes
essential in tackling machine learning challenges.
The course's emphasis on understanding the rationale behind various
methodologies became the guiding beacon of my exploration,
fostering a depth of insight that transcends mere technical competence.

Within the labyrinth of COMPSCI 371,
the exploration of neural networks emerged as an enlightening odyssey.
Unraveling the iterative modification of model parameters to optimize specific
loss functions became more than a computational exercise – it became a
cornerstone of my intellectual foundation. Additionally,
the exposure to diverse approaches,
such as decision forests and support vector machines,
not only broadened my perspective but also catalyzed a holistic understanding of
the multifaceted landscape of machine learning methodologies.

Navigating the intricate landscape of computer networks unfolded through the
lens of COMPSCI 311, aptly named Computer Network Architecture. This course,
with its layered exploration of network protocol stack architecture,
became a pivotal compass guiding my understanding of the interconnected digital
world.
Practical programming exercises and insightful case studies drawn from the vast
expanse of the Internet enriched my comprehension of network concepts.

The reverberations of COMPSCI 311 echoed profoundly in the context of my
signature work,
FedCampus. The in-depth exploration of TCP/IP and HTTP laid a robust foundation
for deciphering the intricate dance of communication between smartphones and our
backend server. This knowledge, a direct outcome of the course,
assumed paramount importance in understanding and optimizing the
representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API)
– a critical component of the FedCampus project.
The course's exploration of wireless and mobile networking served as a prescient
foreshadowing,
aligning seamlessly with the network connections prevalent in smartphones,
an indispensable element of the FedCampus ecosystem.

The intellectual odyssey continued with COMPSCI 402,
an exploration into the captivating realm of Artificial Intelligence. Here,
the boundaries of machine learning expanded,
covering an extensive spectrum of topics – from uninformed and informed search
to the intricacies of neural networks and the strategic maneuvers of game
theory.
This comprehensive overview not only deepened my insights but also unveiled the
decision-making processes embedded in the very fabric of machine learning.
The flexibility afforded by the course project became a gateway to a deeper
exploration, leading me down the corridors of federated learning on smartphones.
This expedition laid the groundwork for my subsequent involvement in the
FedCampus project,
becoming the crucible where innovative solutions took shape and ideas
metamorphosed into action.

The culmination of my thematic explorations found its zenith in the capstone
courses,
where the disparate threads of knowledge woven in the thematic courses converged
into a tapestry of innovation.
These capstone courses served as the alchemical crucible,
where theory and practice, knowledge and skills,
seamlessly melded to birth a project of profound impact.
The tangible outcome of this amalgamation materialized in a demonstration paper
accepted by the esteemed 2024 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications
Workshops. This academic accolade underscored the transformative power of
synthesizing theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and visionary ideas.
Collaborating harmoniously with the FedCampus team,
we transformed concepts into reality,
birthing The FedCampus Application in December 2023.

This real-world application became more than just a testament to our technical
prowess; it became a living embodiment of DKU's animating principles.
Rooted globalism found expression in the collaborative problem-solving inherent
