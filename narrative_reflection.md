curriculum,
and in co-curricular programming that brings students together to learn from
each other outside the classroom.

Collaborative Problem-Solving: To instill the habits of collaboration and the
ability to synthesize disparate insights in solving complex challenges.
This principle is reflected in an interdisciplinary structure that emphasizes
the integration of knowledge, in pedagogies that include team-based assignments,
and in co-curricular programming that emphasize teamwork.

Research and Practice: To enhance the ability to forge links between theory and
practice in the many-sided and rapidly changing world of human need.
This principle is reflected in the divisional foundations,
which impart the basic skills necessary for critical inquiry across many fields
and problems, and in advanced research in the disciplinary studies,
capstone and signature products.
Experiential opportunities that align the formal curriculum with practica,
internships and other hands-on offerings further link theory and practice.

Lucid Communication: To develop the ability to communicate effectively,
both orally and in writing,
and to listen attentively to different viewpoints in coming to mature judgments.
The common core,
divisional foundation and capstone courses provide multiple opportunities for
sustained, guided practice in writing, speaking and listening.
These are supported by stand-alone and co-courses linked to the core,
by required language proficiencies,
by the focus on a summative project that melds research and practical experience
and by the seminar-style size of most classes.

Independence and Creativity: To nurture free inquiry,
deep reflection and a drive to ask interesting questions and find compelling
answers.
These principles are embodied in the liberal arts design of the
curriculum—placing a premium on exploring ideas and seeking new experiences;
encountering different ways of thinking and living in history, text, image,
culture and methodology,
and in the variety of choices among paths of study and electives.

Wise Leadership: To shape thinkers and doers who possess the moral compass to
guide communities and institutions toward a common good and who have the wisdom
and technical competence to deal effectively with complexity.
This principle is present in core courses that examine the relationship between
individuals and different levels of community and to leading an examined life,
in the many interdisciplinary studies that require knowledge of problems that
span national boundaries and cultures, in the required practicum,
and in the capstone seminars where students integrate specialized knowledge with
broader knowledge and questions.

A Purposeful Life: To form reflective scholars who test their core beliefs,
connect their course of study to big questions of meaning,
and who build the capacity for lifelong learning and exploration.
This principle is reflected in the distinctive capacity of a liberal arts
college to form intentional communities of meaning.
It is brought to life in core courses,
in self-designed capstone work and in an e-portfolio system that captures the
larger inquiry informing a student’s pathway.
