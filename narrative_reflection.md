Requirements:

List 3 thematic courses.
Articulate how the 3 thematic courses and the outcome of the capstone courses
contribute to the my signature work.
Reflect on the entire signature work experience and how it prepared me for
future goals.

List experiential learning activities (summer research
scholar/research/projects).
Briefly describe the work completed through experiential learning and how the
experience aligns with DKU’s 7 animating principles.
Examining the intersection between academic preparation,
the experiential learning experience, and signature work.
Include three components based on the DEAL Model: describe experience,
examine what skills were acquired and learned,
articulate how the experiential learning contributed to the signature work.

DKU's 7 animating principles:

Rooted Globalism: To cultivate informed and engaged citizens who are
knowledgeable about each other’s histories,
traditions of thought and affiliations; and skilled in navigating among local,
national and global identities and commitments.
This principle is reflected in the required levels of proficiency in English and
Mandarin,
the core courses and comparative study of cultural traditions throughout the
curriculum,
and in co-curricular programming that brings students together to learn from
each other outside the classroom.

Collaborative Problem-Solving: To instill the habits of collaboration and the
ability to synthesize disparate insights in solving complex challenges.
This principle is reflected in an interdisciplinary structure that emphasizes
the integration of knowledge, in pedagogies that include team-based assignments,
and in co-curricular programming that emphasize teamwork.

Research and Practice: To enhance the ability to forge links between theory and
practice in the many-sided and rapidly changing world of human need.
This principle is reflected in the divisional foundations,
which impart the basic skills necessary for critical inquiry across many fields
and problems, and in advanced research in the disciplinary studies,
capstone and signature products.
Experiential opportunities that align the formal curriculum with practica,
internships and other hands-on offerings further link theory and practice.

Lucid Communication: To develop the ability to communicate effectively,
both orally and in writing,
and to listen attentively to different viewpoints in coming to mature judgments.
The common core,
divisional foundation and capstone courses provide multiple opportunities for
sustained, guided practice in writing, speaking and listening.
These are supported by stand-alone and co-courses linked to the core,
by required language proficiencies,
by the focus on a summative project that melds research and practical experience
and by the seminar-style size of most classes.

Independence and Creativity: To nurture free inquiry,
deep reflection and a drive to ask interesting questions and find compelling
answers.
These principles are embodied in the liberal arts design of the
curriculum—placing a premium on exploring ideas and seeking new experiences;
encountering different ways of thinking and living in history, text, image,
culture and methodology,
and in the variety of choices among paths of study and electives.

Wise Leadership: To shape thinkers and doers who possess the moral compass to
guide communities and institutions toward a common good and who have the wisdom
and technical competence to deal effectively with complexity.
This principle is present in core courses that examine the relationship between
individuals and different levels of community and to leading an examined life,
in the many interdisciplinary studies that require knowledge of problems that
span national boundaries and cultures, in the required practicum,
and in the capstone seminars where students integrate specialized knowledge with
broader knowledge and questions.

A Purposeful Life: To form reflective scholars who test their core beliefs,
connect their course of study to big questions of meaning,
and who build the capacity for lifelong learning and exploration.
This principle is reflected in the distinctive capacity of a liberal arts
college to form intentional communities of meaning.
It is brought to life in core courses,
in self-designed capstone work and in an e-portfolio system that captures the
larger inquiry informing a student’s pathway.

# Signature Work Narrative And Experiential Learning Reflection

## Thematic Courses

### COMPSCI 311 - Computer Network Architecture

Course description:
Introduces students to the fundamentals of computer networks.
Focus on layered architecture of the network protocol stack.
Case studies will be drawn from the Internet,
combined with practical programming exercises.
Concepts include the Internet architecture, HTTP, DNS, P2P, Sockets, TCP/IP,
BGP, routing protocols,
and wireless/mobile networking and their applications such as how to achieve
reliable/secure communications over unreliable/insecure channels,
how to find a good path through a network,
how to share network resources among competing entities,
how to find an object in the network, and how to build network applications.

### COMPSCI 402 - Artificial Intelligence

Course description:
This course covers uninformed search, informed search, constraint satisfaction,
classical planning, neural network, deep learning, hidden Markov model,
Bayesian network, Markov decision process, reinforcement learning,
active learning and game theory.

### STATS 302 - Principles of Machine Learning

Course description:
Fundamental concepts of supervised machine learning,
with sample algorithms and applications.
Focuses on how to think about machine learning problems and solutions,
rather than on a systematic coverage of techniques.
Serves as an introduction to the methods of machine learning.

### Capstone Courses

I collected our work and wrote a demonstration paper during the capstone course
period.
The demonstration paper is recently accepted by the 2024 IEEE Conference on
Computer Communications Workshops.

Additionally,
I worked closely with the FedCampus team to develop The FedCampus Application,
and we launched it in December 2023.

## Experiential Learning Activities

I did a summer research scholar program with Professor Bing Luo,
working on the FedCampus project.
I continued working as a research assistant and led the development of The
FedCampus Application in this research project.

The experience closely aligns with DKU's 7 animating principles.
While researching for FedKit,
the software development kits for federated learning across smartphones,
we collaborated with Flower Labs member Daniel Nata Nugraha from Germany,
researcher Dr. Xiaomin Ouyang at University of California, Los Angeles,
showing our rooted globalism. To build The FedCampus App,
I recruited Luyao Wang as a user interface developer,
and Renyuan Zhang as a user interface designer;
we worked closely to develop the application,
showcasing collaborative problem-solving.
The FedCampus Application is a practical application of federated learning,
representing research and practice. As we were developing the application,
we had many diverse opinions and ideas,
and we had to communicate effectively to make decisions,
which demonstrates lucid communication. During the development of FedKit,
we came up with the idea that we could deploy new machine learning models solely
from the backend server if we always let the client download the latest model;
we also came up with the idea of aggregating machine learning models in
different formats by aligning their parameters;
this demonstrates independence and creativity. As the team leader of FedCampus,
I had to make decisions on each member's priorities and tasks,
and bridge the gap among teammates and between the team and the our advisor;
this requires wise leadership.
Our work was also contributed upstream to the Flower federated learning
framework, helping other federated learning projects and researchers,
showing that the work is meaningful and contributes to the community,
and aligning with the principle of a purposeful life.
