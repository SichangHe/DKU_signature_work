\section{Ground Truth}

To preserve user privacy,
the bottom line is that the raw data must not be collected.

\section{Data Access}

The initial phase of FedCampus operates on participants' health data recorded by
the Huawei Watch Fit 2.
100 smartwatches of this model are purchased to be lent to the participants.

In order to conduct research on the data,
our algorithm needs to access the data from the smartwatch.

In the natural life cycle of the collected health data,
the data are first synchronized from the participants' smartwatches to
the Huawei HealthKit on the their smartphone through Bluetooth.
This is important in two ways:
first, we do not need to develop any software to run on the smartwatches,
only the smartphones; second,
we require the participants to regularly conduct this synchronization process
themselves, which counts into management complexity.

We deploy different strategies to access the data from the Huawei HealthKit on
Android and iOS.
On Android, Huawei provides the Huawei HealthKit API to access the data.
On iOS, Apple restricts third-party access to private data,
and unifies such access to Apple HealthKit,
so we have to first synchronize the data from the Huawei HealthKit to
the Apple HealthKit, then access the data there.
