This work marks the initial step towards realizing \fedcampus,
a privacy-preserving data platform for smart campuses.
Solutions were developed to access health data from smartwatches,
facilitate federated learning across smartphones of different operating systems,
and seamlessly integrate functionalities into a smartphone application for
participants. The introduction of \fedkit,
featuring an innovative machine learning model pipeline and elegant machine
learning operations support,
addresses pivotal challenges encountered during cross-platform federated
learning.

Our experiments,
conducted on The \fedcampus Application with participation from tens of
students, staff, and faculty,
substantiated the efficacy of \fedkit and affirmed the feasibility of our
holistic approach.
While encountering with significant challenges in data access and iOS on-device
training,
the system's inherent flexibility enables it for future enhancements.
As we continue to refine and extend \fedcampus,
addressing these challenges will contribute to the evolution of a robust and
comprehensive privacy-preserving data platform for smart campuses.
