This work is the first step towards \fedcampus,
a privacy-preserving data platform for smart campus.
We developed solutions for accessing health data generated on smartwatches,
conducting federated learning across smartphones of different operating systems,
and integrating the functionalities in a smartphone application interfacing the
participants. To support federated learning across smartphone operating systems,
we developed the \fedkit software development kits,
together with its innovative machine learning model pipeline and elegant machine
learning operations support.
Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of \fedkit and feasibility of our
overall approach,
and we deployed The \fedcampus Application among tens of participants for
experiments.
Though we encountered major challenges in data access and iOS on-device
training,
the system is overall flexible and can be extended in the future to address
these challenges, towards a more robust and comprehensive \fedcampus platform.
