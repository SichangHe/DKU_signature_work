Our data access setup is involved and it is desirable to be simplified.
However, we do not have much control over this process because of
our overall approach.
The data are collected by the proprietary Huawei smartwatches,
and synchronized to the proprietary Huawei HealthKit.
This means that we do not have control over when and how the data is
collected or synchronized.
In the future, it would be desirable to have a more open data access setup,
where we control the data collection and synchronization process.
