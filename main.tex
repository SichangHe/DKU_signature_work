% Abstract in English

\instructions{Abstract (English): 150 -- 200 words. An abstract is a brief
    statement of the problem or the purpose of the research. It should indicate
    the theoretical work or experimental plan used, summarize principal findings
    of the research, and point out major conclusions. Appropriate safety
    information should be included when applicable. This should be the section
    you write last to be sure that it accurately reflects the content of the
    document.}

\fedcampus endeavors to establish a privacy-preserving data platform for
university campuses,
extracting valuable insights while preserving participants' privacy.
This initial phase focuses on accessing personal health data on participants'
smartphones and executing cross-platform federated learning. Federated learning,
a privacy-preserving machine learning technique,
enables model training across multiple edge devices without centralizing raw
data. However,
challenges brought by \fedcampus' advanced requirements for real-world federated
learning on smartphones, including cross-platform support,
dependency on application updates, and interdisciplinary collaboration,
were not addressed by existing federated learning systems. \fedkit,
our innovative software development kits,
address these challenges through a machine learning model pipeline and machine
learning operations support.
Experiments were conducted in both lab-based settings and on The \fedcampus
Application, a smartphone application deployed among students, staff,
and faculty at Duke Kunshan University. Results underscored the effectiveness of
\fedkit and the feasibility of \fedcampus' overall approach,
paving the way for future advancements towards a comprehensive data platform.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\instructions{This section includes a clear statement of the problem and the
    reasons for studying it.~Provide a detailed yet concise background
    discussion of the problem and the significance, scope, and limits of the
    work. Outline what has been done previously by citing truly pertinent
    literature but do not include a general survey of semi-relevant
    literature.~ State how your work differs from earlier work in the field
    and demonstrate the continuity from the previous work to your own.}

\chapter{Methods}
\label{methods}

\instructions{This section is obviously discipline specific so use the
    nomenclature that is common for your discipline. However, this section
    should provide sufficient detail about the materials and the methods
    used so that other experienced workers can repeat the experiment and
    obtain comparable results. Cite the appropriate literature when using a
    standard method or protocol and give only the details needed. Identify
    the materials used in the research. For example, computer systems used,
    mathematical theorems exploited, etc.; give information on the purity of
    all chemicals and reagents employed in the research; include the
    chemical/biological names of all compounds and chemical formulas of
    substances that are new or uncommon. Use standard systematic
    nomenclature to unambiguously define well-established compounds,
    processes, equipment, etc.}

\instructions{Summarize the data collected in this section, and their
    statistical treatment. Include only relevant data, but give sufficient
    detail to justify the conclusions. It is appropriate in this section to
    use equations, figures, and tables to display your data. Extensive, but
    relevant data, should be reserved for an appendix where it is identified
    as supporting information.}

\instructions{The table or figure must follow as closely as possible after the
    paragraph in which it is referenced. Titles/captions should be kept
    brief.}

Federated analytics is a decentralized approach that aggregates statistical
information from multiple sources without compromising individual user data.
To preserve user privacy,
the \fedcampus Application employs a privacy-preserving mechanism known as
differential privacy. Before uploading raw data to our servers,
Gaussian white noise is added to individual user data.
This ensures that the aggregated statistics remain robust while preventing the
identification of specific users.

The decision to utilize differential privacy aligns with our commitment to
protecting user information. Even with this privacy-preserving measure,
the group statistics derived from federated analytics retain their significance.
They provide valuable insights into overall trends and patterns within the
\fedcampus user community.
