                 enabling secure and private machine learning by

                 such as PyTorch in a transparent, lightweight, and
                 user-friendly manner. Its aim is to both help
                 popularize privacy-preserving techniques in machine
                 learning by making them as accessible as possible via
                 Python bindings and common tools familiar to
                 researchers and data scientists, as well as to be
                 extensible such that new Federated Learning (FL),
                 Multi-Party Computation, or Differential Privacy
                 methods can be flexibly and simply implemented and
                 integrated. This chapter will introduce the methods
                 available within the PySyft library and describe their
                 implementations. We will then provide a
                 proof-of-concept demonstration of a FL workflow using
                 an example of how to train a convolutional neural
                 network. Next, we review the use of PySyft in academic
                 literature to date and discuss future use-cases and
                 development plans. Most importantly, we introduce Duet:
