\section{Accessing the Data}

On Android, we use the Huawei HealthKit API Java package to request
Huawei HealthKit for the data.
This API allows access to all the collected raw health data points.
We call the API from using Kotlin,
a programming language compatible with Java,
and aggregate the data into a daily summary.
% TODO: What are the data types.
